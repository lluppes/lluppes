I've been doing this career for a long time, but most of my code repositories and pipelines are in Azure DevOps and in private corporate repositories.

I've just recently started putting a few things into GitHub just to get a little more practice with this tool and the GitHub Actions.

For some more interesting new stuff, see my profile for open source project templates developed while working at Microsoft:  https://github.com/lluppesms/
